AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies

recorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and
relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall
compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. This enables you to simplify compliance

AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS. AWS Security Hub
automatically runs continuous, account-level configuration and security checks based on AWS best practices and
industry standards.
